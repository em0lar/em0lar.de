      I'm em0lar, I'm queer. You may also know me as Leo. You can find most of my projects on [Gitea](git.em0lar.de).


      I'm nonbinary. My English pronouns are they/them. In general I prefer gender neutral pronouns, but if your language doesn't support them you may use both binary pronouns.


      I do a lot of things with train data, such as [FahrplanDatenGarten](https://github.com/FahrplanDatenGarten/FahrplanDatenGarten) and [pyhafas](https://github.com/FahrplanDatenGarten/pyhafas).


      Maybe someday I will write blog posts here.
